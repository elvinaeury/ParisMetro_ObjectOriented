# ParisMetro_ObjectOriented
Shortest Metro and Walk Route Trajectory and Display using Networkx

Networkx is used for:
- graphical display of Paris subway network (with coloured lines corresponding to those provided by RATP)
- determine shortest route (using Dijkstra) to walk and take the subway, while taking into account certain conditions: 
     - walking time
     - transfer time 
     - travel time between metro stations
     - if it takes less time to walk than take metro, then shortest path only considers walking.  
- graphical display shortest route (whether walk and metro, or just metro or walk)


Other add-ins:
- show time taken to travel from two points
- add specific errors when start or destination locations are too far from metros stations
